## CNCF Storage Landscape Whitepaper

The whitepaper documents the storage landscape by clarifying the terminology used in the storage space including:

- The attributes of a storage system such that an end-user can understand the appropriate capabilities that might be required by an application or architectural pattern.
- The layers in a storage solution (or service) with a focus on terminology and how they impact the defined attributes covering the container, orchestrator, transport, topology, virtual/physical, data protection, data services and the non-volatile layers.
- The data access interfaces in terms of volume (including block, file system and shared file system) and application API (including object, KV and database) as high level groupings.
- Separate sections with further detail on Block Storage, File systems, Object Storage and Key Value Stores.
- The management interfaces needed to orchestrate the storage layers to facilitate composability, dynamic provisioning and self service management.
