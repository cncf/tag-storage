# TAG-Storage channels housekeeping

## Identifying and creating channels
Just for approved projects, "sec-assessment-xxxx" exception TAG-Storage channels
are identified with the “tag-storage-” prefix.  Except during conferences, the
CNCF permits slack members to create channels; however, tag-storage-related
channels should only be created by chairs or tech leads, and are typically
prefixed by tag-storage- following hyphenation of the topic/subject.  This
helps the community find topics of relevance as well as discover areas to
collaborate.

It is requested that channels include a header for what it is used for.

Additional information may be found in the [CNCF slack guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/slack-guidelines.md).

## Code of conduct

Members of TAG-Storage channels are expected to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/cncf/tag-storage/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## Posting outside content

The TAG-Storage channels are mechanisms for cloud native storage discussions.
It is expected that outside, non-tag created content will be posted; however,
these should include topics of relevance and interest to the cloud native
community space, rather than marketing or promotion of a vendor-specific
product.

For example, maintainers and contributors of projects are encouraged to post
relevant topics, podcasts, and blogs in the channels provided the content is not
self-endorsing for the sake of driving attention to the project.
